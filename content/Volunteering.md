**Are you interested in the Sonic Arts and want to meet and help out its communities? Are you an artist wanting to contribute to a shared community space? Join us! Toinen Kerros is fully volunteer-run, and everything that happens here is only possible because of the effort and passion of a small group of people. So we are always happy to have more hands and heads to help out!**

We strive to meet regularly on Wednesdays (~18:00 â€“ 20:00) and we have one more structured meeting the first Wednesday of each month. 
Due to conflicting schedules we might occasionally meet on a different day.

In these meetings we get to know each other, eat chips, discuss things to do and the meaning of life and might also do some practical work related to the space. We coordinate on a Signal group chat.

Contact us @ info(at)aanenlumo.com to participate or to get more information!
