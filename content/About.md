# What is Toinen Kerros

_Toinen Kerros_ (TK) is a *volunteer-led, low threshold, DIY space for presenting, practicing, and encountering sonic art practices*. Founded and currently facilitated by the association Äänen Lumo, it aims to function as a community-driven space. Its rent and basic running costs are partly covered by the Kone Foundation until spring 2027 at the latest.
Toinen Kerros is located in Nokiantie 2-4, 2. kerros (2. floor), Helsinki, Finland.

## Founding bla bla 
The current way of operating TK is to offer the space and its resources (see below for a detailed list) free of charge for unfunded organisers, and to ask for a fair contribution to those with more resources. All the income is reinvested to make TK a more functional space and to cover unforeseen expenses (see below the financing paragraph).

Unlike what happens in commercial venues, everything here is managed and taken care of exclusively by a small community of volunteers. We thus ask you as organisers / artists / participants to take responsibility for the event, for example covering the costs of transportation or rent of additional equipment, communications, hosting guests, building any possible installations, hanging artworks and cleaning the space after the event so it is ready for the next event. It is also expected that both the space and its resources are used with utmost care.

### Technical help 
Depending on the organiser’s needs, technical assistance can be provided if specified, although in certain cases to be agreed upon it should be possible for the communities within the network of TK to operate the space and its resources more independently, for example for rehearsals or other initiatives without an audience.
